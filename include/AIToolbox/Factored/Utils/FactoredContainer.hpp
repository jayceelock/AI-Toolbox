     * tries to be as efficient as possible, with tradeoffs for space and
     * time.

     * automatically inserts an id one greater than the last as value
     * within the trie, using the specified partial state as key.
     *
     * This data structure can then be filtered by Factors, and it will
     * match the Factors against all the PartialFactors that completely
     * match it.
